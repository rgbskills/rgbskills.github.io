  <h1>My story of becoming a Web-developer</h1>
      <h2>by: Zoltan Benko, your friendly next door Developer
      <br />Birthday: 26 August 1991</h2>

      <p>
      My story started a long time ago, I was only 9 when I started taking things apart in the house, I had to know how things work. I remember not sleeping for days because I couldn't figure out how the television works. One day, someone explained to me that there is some electron gun that makes up the image. Of course, for me that explanation was more fiction than science because I didn't understand what an electron gun was, but I continued to be fascinated by technology even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started to build little toy cars and portable flashlights and after a while I figured out that “robotics” will always be only a hobby for me. I was very sad for a while but all that was about to change, because a few days later my brother took me to an Internet club and introduced me to the world of computers and world wide web. He told me that there are these things called websites that you can access via web-address and you can search for other websites that contain the information you are searching for. Little did I know that I just started my career that day.
      </p>
      <p>
        My brother told me that anyone can have a website and the whole world can access it. He also introduced me to HTML, sadly my bro was more interested in other things and left me with only the basic ideas but it was enough to get very excited and I started to learn on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly, Christmas was coming and our parents surprised us with a PC which was a big deal back then and even more so for us. Of course we did not have home Internet yet, but that didn't stop me from building my first website. I was so preoccupied with computers that school for me became second.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried to fuse school and my love for computers together, but the educational system failed to offer me what I needed, so I decided that I have to do this on my own. I shortly started to make money using my skills and that made me happy. Unfortunately, I was scoring very low in school and my parents never figured out, or understood the path that I was on. Of course, I can't blame them for that. Back then, all parents wanted their kids to grow up to be engineers or doctors. They thought that there's no future in computers and Internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, my parents started to realize that this obsession of mine is the future and wanted to help me. However, I was extremely behind with other materials in school, that for some reason you need to know if you want to go to college. So I decided I will try without the shiny paper and teach myself everything that I need to know. My most recent finished education is a secondary school for Travel Guide. I'm not sure why I did that, but it was lots of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had great success, both with clients and jobs over the years as a web developer and of course I had a few failures too, but I couldn't be happier with what I have accomplished so far and I know this is only the beginning...
